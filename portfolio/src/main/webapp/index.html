      <h2 style="background-color:tomato">About Me</h2>
      <h3>What Do I Study?</h3>
      <p>I am a student at the University of Sydney, and I just finished my third year 
          of a Combined Bachelor of Engineering (Software) and Science degree. 
      </p>
      <h3>Google Experience</h3>
      <p>I am a 2020/2021 STEP intern at Google on the ChromeOS team. This is my 
          first internship so I am very excited! My hosts are Austin, Eizan, Daniel 
          and Thanh and my pod interns are Anna and Therese.
      </p>
      <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
      <p>I love going to the beach and recently my boyfriend has been teaching 
          me how to surf. I aim to improve over the summer and be able to catch 
          waves on my own. 
      </p>
      <p>I also enjoy cooking with my brother. We love making pastas and baking 
        various treats.</p>
      <h2 style="background-color:orange">Projects I've Worked On</h2>
      <h3>Rocketry</h3>
      <p>At the beginning of this year, I joined the USYD Rocketry society and 
          have been working on the Technical Payload team. This has been a
          great experience for me to work along-side fellow univeristy students
          on an extracurricular project that I am interested in. Most of my work 
          on this team has focused on writing and testing Arduino code for the 
          various components in the system. 
      </p>
      <h3>Simplified Version Control System</h3>
      <p>For one of my units of study in semester 1 in this year, I worked on 
          creating a simplified VCS similar to Git. This was relatively challenging
          however after completing the assignment, I had a much better understanding
          of VCSs.
